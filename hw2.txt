24. The probability for the 3 girls to be the oldest would be 5%.

Since there are 3 girls and 3 boys (6 children in total), we can solve it with permutations, and so we would have ( (3!) * (3!) ) / (6!) which represents the probability (with the formula in mind being: P= favorable cases/possible cases), and so we would have the result 0.05, which represents a 5% chance for the gils to be the oldest ones.


28. P = 1-10*9*8/1000


29. a) The right sign would be >. It requires at least 1 die to hit number 6 in order to get the value 21 with 4 dice, but to get the value 22, it would require at least 2 dice that would be 6, and so the probability to get the value 21 is greater than the probability to get the value 22.

b) Since in the first case we need to have the first and last letters to be the same and in the second case, the first and the last should be as well the same, whatever the middle letter may be, it means that the probability is equal. The adequate sign in this case is =.
